## What is this workshop?

This is a hands-on lab that takes you from raw LLM inference all the way through
a realistic agentic security attack, using a purpose-built application running
in your own Kubernetes lab cluster. The four lab exercises take roughly 2.5 hours; allow
~3 hours total including setup, a break, and wrap-up.

You will build a small HR assistant backed by a self-hosted LLM, connect it to tools,
extend it with MCP, and then break it deliberately — watching SQL injection,
data exfiltration, and audit-log contrast play out in real time.

## What you will build across the four labs

| Lab | Topic | Time |
|-----|-------|------|
| **Lab 1** — Inference | Direct LLM calls, prompt injection | ~30 min |
| **Lab 2** — Agents | Explicit tool-call loop, chained actions | ~45 min |
| **Lab 3** — MCP | Dynamic discovery, hot tool swap | ~30 min |
| **Lab 4** — Security | SQLi, data exfil, observability contrast | ~45 min |

## Learning objectives

After completing these labs you will be able to:

1. Explain how LLM inference works and why system-prompt isolation is not a
   security boundary.
2. Describe the agentic loop (LLM + loop + tools) and trace a multi-step tool
   call through the Trace panel.
3. Explain MCP and why dynamic tool discovery changes the attack surface.
4. Demonstrate SQL injection and data exfiltration through an AI agent, and
   explain why conventional controls miss it.
5. Articulate why audit logging is the prerequisite for any defensive response.

## Optional: FortiAIGate integration

This workshop stands on its own. All labs run against an Ollama instance in
your own lab cluster, with no external AI services.

If you want to extend the experience with enterprise AI security controls, the
[FortiAIGate Workshop](https://fortinetcloudcse.github.io/faig-training-workshop/)
picks up where Lab 4 ends: you change one value (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`) to route the
same agent through FortiAIGate, then explore input/output guardrails, AI Flow
policies, and the detection story — using the same attack chain you ran in Lab 4.

## Prerequisites

Everything runs in the lab environment provided for the session: an Azure
Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster that you drive from a terminal in your browser.
You need:

- A modern web browser
- The lab credentials handed out at the start of the session

See [Setup & Prerequisites](./01Intro) for the full walkthrough.
