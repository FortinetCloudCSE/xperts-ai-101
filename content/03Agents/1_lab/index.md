Lab 2 brings up the agent and UI alongside Ollama. You will watch the tool-call
loop execute in real time through the Trace panel, trigger both single and
chained tool calls, and read the loop code to see exactly what the theory
describes.

**Docker Compose** — every command on this page runs on your own machine.

Before you start, confirm Lab 1's Ollama container is still up:

```bash
cd ~/ai-101/lab-app/compose
docker compose ps
```

Expect `ollama` with state `running`. If it is not, redo the Lab 1 deploy step.

*On Kubernetes instead? Click the **Kubernetes / Helm** tab — every lab page will
follow your choice.*

**Kubernetes / Helm** — every command on this page runs in your Cloud Shell session
against your cluster.

Before you start, confirm the cluster and your Ollama port-forward:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=ai101
jobs
```

Expect the `ai101-ollama` pod `Running`, and the Ollama port-forward from setup
listed by `jobs`. If it is missing, restart it:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ai101-ollama 11434:11434 > /tmp/ai101-ollama-port-forward.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

```bash
cd ~/ai-101/lab-app/compose
docker compose --profile lab1 down 2>/dev/null; true
docker compose --profile lab2 up -d

Expected: `ollama`, `agent`, and `ui` all running.

Confirm the agent is up and in hardcoded mode:

Open the Kubernetes UI using the NodePort URL.

## Step 1 — Single tool call

In the chat box UI: 

> Who is in the Engineering department?

Watch the **Trace** panel on the right. You should see:

```
query_employees(filter="Engineering")
→ {"employees": [{"name": "Alice Chen", ...}, ...]}
```

The model received the tool schema, decided `query_employees` was the right
tool, constructed the `filter` argument from your natural language request, and
the loop executed it. The model never touched the database directly.

Verify via the API:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="Verify"%}}
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/tools | jq '.tools[].name'
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab title="Expected Output" style="info" %}}
```
"query_employees"
"send_message"
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

---

## Step 2 — Chained tool calls across two iterations

> Find Alice Chen's manager and send them a message saying Alice will be 15 minutes late today.

This requires two tool calls the model cannot batch into one turn:
1. `query_employees` to find Alice and her manager.
2. `send_message` to notify the manager.

- Watch the Trace panel show both steps:

 ![tracepanel](./tracepanel.png)

- Then confirm the outbox received the message:

 ![outbox](./outbox.png)

- Now from the terminal run the following:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="Verify message received"%}}
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/outbox | jq '.messages'
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab title="Expected Output" style="info" %}}
```
[
  {
    "to": "Carol Singh",
    "body": "Hi Carol, I wanted to inform you that Alice Chen will be 15 minutes late today. She mentioned it might be due to a last-minute client meeting."
  }
]
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

{{% notice style="warning" title="Output may vary" %}}
LLM responses are non-deterministic, so exact wording and behavior can differ
between runs — even with identical prompts and inputs.
{{% /notice %}}


{{% notice style="tip" title="If the model narrates instead of acting" %}}
Small models occasionally describe what they *would* do ("I would send a message
to Bob...") instead of calling the tool. If the outbox is empty, try the more
explicit phrasing:

```
Use the query_employees tool to find who manages Alice Chen,
then use the send_message tool to tell them Alice will be 15 minutes late today.
```
{{% /notice %}}

## Step 3 — No-tool response

> What is 2 + 2?

The model answers directly — `finish_reason` is `stop` on the first LLM call.
The Trace panel will be empty for this turn. The loop exited at iteration 0.

This is worth seeing explicitly: the loop only runs tools when the model
decides to. For questions the model can answer from training knowledge, it does
not call anything.

---

## Step 4 — Read the loop

Open `lab-app/images/agent/main.py` and find `_run_agent()`. The core of it:

```python
for iteration in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):          # hard cap at 5
    response = await _llm(messages)
    finish   = response["choices"][0]["finish_reason"]
    msg      = response["choices"][0]["message"]

    if finish == "tool_calls":
        messages.append(msg)                      # add assistant's request to history
        for tc in msg["tool_calls"]:
            result = await _run_tool(tc["function"]["name"],
                                     json.loads(tc["function"]["arguments"]))
            messages.append({                     # add result to history
                "role":         "tool",
                "tool_call_id": tc["id"],
                "content":      result,
            })
    else:
        return msg["content"]                     # done
```

Identify in the actual file:
- Where `finish_reason == "tool_calls"` branches.
- Where tool results are appended to `messages` before the next LLM call.
- What happens when `MAX_ITERATIONS` is reached.
- How `_run_tool()` hides whether the backend is hardcoded or MCP.

The abstraction in `_run_tool()` is the reason Module 3 can swap the tool
backend without changing a single line in this loop.

---

## What just happened

The model never directly read the database or sent a message. It requested
those actions by emitting structured JSON, and the loop executed them. If the
model had been given a manipulated instruction, the loop would have executed
whatever that instruction requested — because that is the only thing the loop
does.

This is the core agentic security question: **who authorizes the tool call?**
Module 4 is the answer.

## Recap

You should now be able to:
- Describe the agent loop in terms of `finish_reason` and message accumulation.
- Trigger a single tool call, a chained call, and a no-tool response.
- Find the loop code and identify each branch.

FortiAIGate sits between the agent and the LLM and sees every request,
including tool schemas and the model's tool-call decisions. AI Flow policies
can intercept or log specific tool invocations before they execute. See the
