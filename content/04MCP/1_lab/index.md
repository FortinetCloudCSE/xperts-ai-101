Lab 3 switches the agent from hardcoded tools to MCP-discovered tools — without
changing a line of agent code. You will see dynamic discovery in action, add
a new tool to a running system without restarting the agent, and observe that
the agent loop behaves identically regardless of which backend is active.

**Docker Compose** — every command on this page runs on your own machine.

Before you start, confirm Lab 2's stack is still up:

```bash
cd ~/ai-101/lab-app/compose
docker compose ps
```

Expect `ollama`, `agent`, and `ui` with state `running`. If they are not, redo the
Lab 2 deploy step.

*On Kubernetes instead? Click the **Kubernetes / Helm** tab — every lab page will
follow your choice.*

**Kubernetes / Helm** — every command on this page runs in your Cloud Shell session
against your cluster.

Before you start, confirm the cluster and your agent port-forward:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=ai101
jobs
```

Expect the `ai101-ollama`, `ai101-agent`, and `ai101-ui` pods `Running`, and the
agent port-forward from Lab 2 listed by `jobs`. If it is missing, restart it:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ai101-agent 8001:8001 > /tmp/ai101-agent-port-forward.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

*Running locally with Docker instead? Click the **Docker Compose** tab — every lab
page will follow your choice.*

## Deploy

{{< pathtabs >}}
{{% pathtab path="docker" %}}
```bash
cd ~/ai-101/lab-app/compose
docker compose --profile lab2 down 2>/dev/null; true
docker compose --profile lab3 up -d
```

Verify:
```bash
cd ~/ai-101/lab-app/compose
docker compose ps
curl -s http://localhost:8001/health | jq .
# Expected: "tool_mode": "mcp"
curl -s http://localhost:8001/tools | jq '.tools[].name'
# Expected: "query_employees", "send_message"
```
{{% /pathtab %}}
{{% pathtab path="k8s" %}}
```bash
cd ~/ai-101/lab-app/helm
helm upgrade --install ai101 ./ai101 -f ai101/values-lab3.yaml
kubectl wait deployment/ai101-agent --for=condition=Available --timeout=120s
```

Start the agent port-forward only if it is not already forwarded (check with `jobs`):

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ai101-agent 8001:8001 > /tmp/ai101-agent-port-forward.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

The UI is reachable directly via NodePort:

```bash
echo "UI: http://$(whoami)-worker.$(az group show -n $(whoami)-k8s101-workshop --query location -o tsv).cloudapp.azure.com:30280"
```

Verify:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/health | jq .
# Expected: "tool_mode": "mcp"
curl -s http://localhost:8001/tools | jq '.tools[].name'
# Expected: "query_employees", "send_message"
```
{{% /pathtab %}}
{{< /pathtabs >}}

---

## Step 1 — Same agent, different backend

Open the UI, then ask the question below.

{{< pathtabs >}}
{{% pathtab path="docker" %}}
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
{{% /pathtab %}}
{{% pathtab path="k8s" %}}

Open the FQDN link printed by the `echo` command in the Deploy step above
(NodePort `30280`).

{{% /pathtab %}}
{{< /pathtabs >}}

> Who is in the Engineering department?

The response is identical to Lab 2. The Trace panel shows the same tool call.
The only difference is how that call was dispatched: over HTTP to the MCP
server rather than as a direct function call in the same process.

Check how the agent currently sees its tools:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="Check tools"%}}
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/tools | jq '{mode: .mode, tools: [.tools[].name]}'
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab title="Expected Output" style="info" %}}
```
{
  "mode": "mcp",
  "tools": [
    "query_employees",
    "send_message"
  ]
}
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

---

## Step 2 — Compare discovery vs hardcoded

Open `lab-app/images/agent/main.py` and compare the two loader functions:

```python
def _load_hardcoded() -> None:
    global _schemas, _dispatch
    _schemas  = tool_module.TOOL_SCHEMAS    # static list from tools.py
    _dispatch = tool_module.TOOL_FUNCTIONS

async def _discover_mcp() -> None:
    global _schemas
    async with streamablehttp_client(MCP_BASE_URL) as (read, write, _):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            result = await session.list_tools()
    _schemas = [                            # same format, different source
        {"type": "function", "function": {
            "name": t.name, "description": t.description, "parameters": t.inputSchema
        }}
        for t in result.tools
    ]
```

Both functions produce the same `_schemas` format. Everything below them in
`main.py` — the `_run_agent()` loop, the LLM call, the trace — is unchanged.

Now find `_run_tool()` and see how the dispatch differs between modes. The loop
itself never calls this function differently.

---

## Step 3 — Add a tool without restarting the agent

{{< pathtabs >}}
{{% pathtab path="docker" %}}
```bash
cd ~/ai-101/lab-app/compose
ENABLE_EXTRA_TOOL=true docker compose --profile lab3 up -d mcp-server
```

Expected: only the `mcp-server` container is recreated.
{{% /pathtab %}}
{{% pathtab path="k8s" %}}
```bash
cd ~/ai-101/lab-app/helm
helm upgrade ai101 ./ai101 -f ai101/values-lab3.yaml \
    --set mcpServer.enableExtraTool=true
```

Expected output:

```
Release "ai101" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: ai101
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Jul 15 19:13:24 2026
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 8
DESCRIPTION: Upgrade complete
TEST SUITE: None
```
{{% /pathtab %}}
{{< /pathtabs >}}

- Only the MCP server was restarted. The agent container is still running with
its previous tool list. Trigger re-discovery without touching the agent:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="Discovery" %}}
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/tools/refresh | jq .
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab title="Expected Output" style="info" %}}
```
{
  "refreshed": true,
  "count": 3
}
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

- Check updated tools now

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="Check updated tools" %}}

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/tools | jq '.tools[].name'

```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab title="Expected Output" style="info" %}}
```
"query_employees"
"send_message"
"search_web"
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}


The agent now knows about `search_web`. The model can call it on the next
request. No rebuild. No code change.

---

## Step 4 — Use the new tool

In the chat box:

> Search the web for recent news about AI in enterprise security.

The Trace panel should show `search_web` being called. The result is stubbed
(the server returns canned text), but the full discovery → schema registration
→ tool call → result flow is real.

---

## What just happened

The agent discovered and used a tool it had no knowledge of at startup, without
a code change or restart. This is exactly what makes MCP compelling for
production environments: tool capability expands without touching the agent.

It is also what makes it a new attack surface. The model reads tool
descriptions the same way it reads any other text — as instructions. A
description that has been modified by an attacker becomes an instruction the
model will follow. Module 4 shows what that looks like.

## Recap

You should now be able to:
- Explain the two-phase MCP interaction: discovery and execution.
- Describe what changes between Lab 2 and Lab 3 (only the tool backend).
- Add a tool to a running system and confirm the agent picks it up.

{{% notice style="info" title="Optional: FortiAIGate extension" %}}
When the agent routes through FortiAIGate, the gateway sees every MCP
tool-call request and response. AI Flow policies can inspect which tools are
being called and with what arguments — visibility the MCP server itself does
not provide. See the
[FortiAIGate Workshop](https://fortinetcloudcse.github.io/faig-training-workshop/).
